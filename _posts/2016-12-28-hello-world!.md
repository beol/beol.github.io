One of my goal for 2016 was to start writing my own thoughts again. It's been far too long since I wrote on [my old blog](https://beol.laksmana.com/).

However instead of posting new stuff there, I've decided to create a new blog on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Not only this gives me time to learn something new, i.e. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but it also gives me a degree of control with the styling and interactivity.

You can take a look at the source code for the blog [here](https://github.com/beol/beol.github.io).

Hope you enjoy reading my stuff. Thanks for coming.
