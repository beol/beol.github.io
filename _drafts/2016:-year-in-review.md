One of my goal for 2016 was to start writing my own thoughts, mostly technical, otherwise just random rants [1]. Took me long enough to write the first piece ;)

2016 came and went, lots of things achieved but there are still a few things left to be desired.

### The Goals

#### Do an IronMan 70.3

One of my goals before turning 40 was to finish a full IronMan event. I had things planned out, beginning 2012 with a “discovery” distance, graduating each year to farther and farther distances, e.g. 2013 sprint distance, 2014 olympic distance, etc.

I was supposed to do my first IronMan 70.3 last year, registered for IronMan 70.3 Vietnam in Danang. But it took a back seat as I just switched job and the cost was too prohibitive for me to go.

In fact, 2015 was the year that I didn’t put any serious effort training for anything in running and triathlon. Though I had a flexible working hour, my job required me to do an on-call rotation, something that I didn’t signed up for when I took the job, thus I couldn’t plan my training and events properly to my liking.

After some job searching, I ended getting my old job back. It allows me to plan for IronMan 70.3 in 2016. I chose IronMan 70.3 Bintan, as it was just across Singapore and familiar place because I’ve had done Bintan Triathlon in 2013 (sprint distance) and 2014 (olympic distance).
