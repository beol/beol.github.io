__TL;DR__ I finished Ironman 70.3 Bintan in 7:07:31, 7 minutes outside my target.

The biggest theme for me in 2016 is to finish an Ironman 70.3/Half Ironman (1.9 km swim, 90 km bike, 21.1 km run). I signed up back in December 2015 to do [IronMan 70.3 Bintan](http://www.ironmanbintan.com).

### The Background

When I first thought of doing triathlon in 2012, I told myself that one of the dream is to finish Ironman (3.8 km swim, 180 km bike, 42.195 km run) by the time I turned 40 years old. I had it all planned out at the time, doing farther and father distances each year.

I started out with "mini" distance (250 m swim, 10 km bike, 2.5 km run) in 2012. The next year, 2013, I did sprint distance (750 m swim, 20 km bike, 5 km run). In 2014, jumped up to Olympic distance (1.5 km swim, 40 km bike, 10 km run).

By 2015, I was supposed to jump up to Ironman 70.3. In fact I've signed up for Ironman 70.3 Vietnam in Danang. But I've decided not to go because it cost too much to travel. Thus the dream of finishing an Ironman by 40 was going down the drain. But still, it doesn't mean that I won't do one.

### The Journey

#### Ketogenic Diet

2015 was the year that I didn't take care of myself, as I hardly put any effort in training. By the end of the year my weight hover around 73-74kg. To get into training, first I had to loose some weight. At 74 kg, I was considered overweight at the time and it would be taxing to my body to train at that weight. So I decided to do Ketogenic Diet partly because some of my closest friends were already doing it at the time, with good results; losing around 10 kg and in some cases upwards of 20-25 kg.

So what is Ketogenic Diet? Ketogenic Diet, or keto diet for short, is a diet plan high in fat, "just enough" protein and low-carb. In the era where everything is low fat, low calories, etc., doing a high fat diet seems odd doesn't it? So here's my brief primer on why this diet works beautifully, and for endurance athlete it has good benefit.

There are 2 kinds of fuel your body runs on, a) glucose (by breaking down carbohydrates and glycogen), and b) fat. People get carbs from rice, wheat, and some green vegetables. Glycogen is stored in muscles, and it's normally produced by consuming protein. In normal diet, where consumption of carbohydrates is high, it would be first to be metabolized to produce glucose. When there are no more carbohydrate, your body will start taking the stored glycogen in your muscle but this process is normally anaerobic. When all of them are depleted, your brain tells your body to start breaking down stored fat for fuel, and during the process of breaking down body fat, ketones is produced. In Ketogenic Diet, you conditioned your body to use your body fat as fuel, by consuming low amount of carbs, and just enough protein. The high fat part makes you feel full faster and longer.

With target weight of 60 kg, I started keto diet on the last week of December 2015. Initially, I didn't do any swim, bike, and run training at all but instead I focused on doing some easy [Freelectics](https://www.freeletics.com/en/) and pilates. By the second week of January 2016, I had lost about 2 kg which was pretty encouraging.

It's now been a year since I started the diet, and I weigh around 65 kg. I haven't manage to achieve the 60 kg target. The closest I got was 62 kg in June, after fasting in Ramadan. After then, my weight has been ranging in the 63-65 kg. It seems like my weight loss has plateaued since then. Losing close to 10 kg has been great for me. Am I dissapointed that I haven't achieved my target weight? Not really. Do I still want to achieve it? You bet I do, but I don't feel like it's necessary anymore as I feel great.
